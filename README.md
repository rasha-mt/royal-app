## Run the project
You don't have to do any specific work:

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Composer install
- Make the .env file
- Migrate & seed the data.
- Run the project.
- That's it!.
